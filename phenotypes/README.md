# Phenotyping algorithms for "A nationwide deep learning pipeline to predict stroke and COVID-19 death in atrial fibrillation"

Electronic health record phenotyping algorithms for defining diseases, medications, lifestyle risk factors, biomarkers and other concepts can  be found [here](https://github.com/BHFDSC/CCU020/tree/main/england/phenotypes).   
These phenotypes were developed for the nationwide evaluation of antithrombotic use and COVID-19 outcomes and were re-used in this work where relevant (e.g. atrial fibrillation, stroke, CHA2DS2-VASc components, BMI).   


Additional information on COVID-19 phenotypes can be found in the work by CCU0013 on characterising [COVID-19 related events in a nationwide electronic health record cohort of 55.9 million people in England](https://github.com/BHFDSC/CCU013_01_ENG-COVID-19_event_phenotyping/tree/main/phenotypes).
